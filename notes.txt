 One of those is that, while the smaps entry tracks references to memory mapped into the process's address space, it does not track page-cache memory used when files are accessed with system calls like read() or write().
That memory, too, is used by the process, so there would be value in knowing how much of it there is. Perhaps more importantly, the "referenced" state of each page is used by the memory-management subsystem itself to make decisions on which pages to evict. Resetting every page to the "not referenced" state will thus perturb page reclaim, and probably not for the better. If these measurements are to be made often, it would be good to have a less invasive way to make them.
